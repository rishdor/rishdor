# Backend-first .NET Engineer | ASP.NET Core APIs | Systems & Cloud-oriented | React integration

I’m a junior engineer with commercial experience building production systems in **C#** and **ASP.NET Core**. I design and implement APIs, business logic, data access layers, and automated testing.

I build complete systems end-to-end, with **backend ownership** and practical frontend implementation (**React / React Native**) focused on data flow, authentication, state management, and API contracts rather than UI/UX design.

Currently developing an **independent full-stack application** that combines backend services, a mobile client, cloud architecture planning, and upcoming AI-powered features.

## 🚀 Selected Projects

**Independent Full-Stack Application (in progress)**
End-to-end system under active development, including backend API, mobile application, and cloud-ready architecture. Backend design, API structure, and system integration are fully owned; frontend work focuses on application flow and data interaction. Deployment and AI integration are currently in progress.

**API-Based Backend Project**
System with non-trivial business rules, database modeling, and structured API design.
